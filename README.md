# odin_landing_page

This is a project as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP). I will be making a website landing page as part of  [Project: Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). 

I will be practising using Flexbox to create a landing page design and consilidating the HTML and CSS knowledge I have gathered in the course so far.
